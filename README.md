# Dogs web api coding test (Backend)
 I have included .env file as well, for easier to start.
## MVP
- Basic GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- Login logics
- ... Yet to decide

## Ways to start using this project
1. Docker
 To Start with Docker, create a folder and then run <code>docker volume create data && git clone https://github.com/larrywongkahei/DogsWebAPICodingTest_Backend.git && git clone https://github.com/larrywongkahei/DogsWebAPICodingTest.git && mv ./DogsWebAPICodingTest/compose.yaml .&&docker compose up</code> After that, you can go to your broswer and type in [localhost](http://localhost) and enter. Enjoy
2. Start up separately, Frontend and Backend
 To start with this approach, clone my frontend and backend first, then within my **Frontend** directory, run <code>npm install && npm run dev</code>. then go into my **Backend** directory, run <code>npm install && npm run start</code>. Enjoy.
