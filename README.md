# Dogs web api coding test (Backend)
 I have included .env file as well, for easier to start.
## MVP
- Basic GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- Login logics
- ... Yet to decide

## Ways to start using this project
1. Docker
 To Start with Docker, create a folder and then clone my frontend and backend in the folder you created. After that, move the compose.yaml file a level up and simply run a command docker compose up. Enjoy
2. Start up separately, Frontend and Backend
 To start with this approach, clone my frontend and backend first, then within my **Frontend** directory, run <code>npm install && npm run dev</code>. then go into my **Backend** directory, run <code>npm install && npm run start</code>. Enjoy!
3. Visit my oracle instance that running this project. [Press me](http://130.162.172.61/)
